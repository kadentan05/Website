            <h3>I love your style. I love the way you speak. I love your voice. I love all the little things about us. The way you</h3>
            <h3>put me over yourself. The little fights we have. Our first time experiences we share together. Like the concerts,</h3>
            <h3>visiting and seeing places together, and hopefully Asia this summer!</h3>

            <h3>nervous about giving it to you and at first I was going to put it in the middle of the flowers when I picked you up</h3>
            <h3>that day. But when it got to that point I was just too nervous and decided not to. Eventually, it just so happened that</h3>
            <h3>when we got In n Out and I asked if you loved me. And when you said you did. It was all I needed to hear and when I</h3>
            <h3>put that ring on your finger, it was a promise that despite everything we will be together no matter what. And that</h3>
            <h3>I will love you, no matter what. Although, the way I gave the ring to you wasn't perfect. I would never change it.</h3>
